  location: "San Francisco Bay Area",
  personal: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I earned a B.A. in Philosophy in 2013, and spent my early-mid 20s as a music producer and songwriter. I lived in Dallas, Nashville, and Kansas City, writing and performing in bars and clubs while collaborating with the musicians I met along the way. In 2018 I was spending less time on music, and had realized that my enjoyment of the art would remain whether or not it was my source of income. I began coding for fun and out of curiosity for the new creative outlets it would open up. I soon realized I was spending all my free time at the keyboard, hacking and learning.",
  personal_two: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began with C# and Unity, then Swift, then Python, and then C++ and OpenGL. After a year of self-teaching, I decided to hire a bootcamp in order to tell me what <em>not</em> to study, and to give my interest the focus it would require to build a useful skillset. I attended the Hack Reactor Immersive in San Francisco, and am now a web developer with interests in security, embedded systems, and augmented reality.",
  technical: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've written persistent apps in Postgres, Mongodb and Neo4j, and deployed them with AWS EC2 and Docker. I work mainly with web technologies such as React and Node, but also picked up C in order to get closer with the machine."
