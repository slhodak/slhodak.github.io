  summary: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a web developer with personal interests in information security, robotics, and augmented reality.",
  personal: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2013 I earned a B.A. in Philosophy from Boston University, and I spent my early-mid 20s as a music producer and songwriter. Over the years I had coded for fun, and I eventually found myself spending all my free time hacking and learning.",
  personal_two: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began with C# and Unity, then tried Swift, Python, and C++. After a year of self-teaching, I enrolled in the Hack Reactor Software Engineering Immersive. I hired them in order to tell me what <strong>not</strong> to study, and to help me focus on building a useful, coherent skillset, which I'm happy to say they did extremely well.",
  technical: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been a professional developer since the end of my time at Hack Reactor. I'm endlessly curious about software, and the little joke I like to make that my goal is to make sure my computer and I never have a reason to misunderstand each other."
